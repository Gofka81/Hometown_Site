# Project Readme

## Navigation
For navigation, I have included a navigation bar at the top of each page that links to the home page, about page, and contact page. This will allow users to easily navigate between pages. Also I added more smooth transition between page links to make web site look more appealing for guests.

## Layout
The layout of each page is designed to be simple and easy to read. I have used a consistent header and footer on each page, with the main content in the center. I have also used a grid layout to ensure that the content is aligned properly and easy to read on any device. To make site more interesting I added simple animated content interactoin, it will help to hold visitor's attantion more longer.

## Colour Choices
I have chosen a simple color scheme for this project, using shades of blue and gray and white. These colours are the colours of my town, so they would fit nicely. This color scheme is intended to be calming and easy on the eyes, while still providing enough contrast to make the content easy to read.

## Challenges Faced
Hardes challenge I faced while creating this project was ensuring that the layout was consistent across different devices and screen sizes. To address this challenge, I used a responsive design approach, using CSS media queries to adjust the layout based on the screen size.
Also, idea and design visualision is not the easiest proccess that require dozens of attempts to create visualy appealing web site, that would be intuitive and pleasant to use.
