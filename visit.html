                        <p>The first City Hall as a sign of a local self-government appeared in Drogobych after receiving Magdeburg rights in 1422. For centuries at this place in the city center on the Market Square (Ploshcha Rynok) the several buildings of the City Hall changed one another.</p>
    
                        <p>The last (fourth) one was built in 1926-29 by the project 1926 of lviv architects Jan Semkovych and Marian Nikodemovych. City Hall Tower is a “remainder” of the previous City Hall 1824-29. It was just finished up and the dome was added.</p>
                        
                        <p>At first, the clock tower was guarded by griffins, but in 1950 it was destroyed and dismantled by the Soviet government. In the pictures that were published in Drogobych in 1930 by Balitsky, you can see how that birds looked like. City Hall is an architectural monument of local value, one of the most beautiful in western Ukraine.</p>

                        <p>In 2013, it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as part of the object “The wooden churches of the Carpathian region in Poland and Ukraine.”</p>
                        <p>The church was brought to Drohobych from the Carpathian village of Nadiiv in 1656. It was exchanged for salt, dismantled and transported to Drohobych on oxen. The building was installed on the site of the previous burned down church. In 1678, a bell tower was built next to it.</p>

Before the First World War, the building belonged to the industrialist Zeman, and in the interwar period, the famous local radiologist Leon Himmel worked here. Another name of the villa comes from the name of the beautiful Bianca, an unattainable beauty mentioned by Bruno Schulz in his story “Spring”. Now the villa houses one of the departments of the “Drogobychchyna” museum – the Palace of Arts.</p>

                        <p>The Drohobych salt plant, in existence since 1250, is one of the oldest working salt plant in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Drohobych salt plant has been in operation since at least the 13th century on territory close to sources of raw materials called "salt brine". The foundation of the salt plant was in 1250, and it is believed that this plant is the oldest working industrial company in Ukraine. During this time, Drohobych was one of the richest cities in the Carpathian region making this important in the history of the last decades in the existence of the Galicia-Volhynia principality.</p>
                        <p> Drohobych's growth was caused by the salt manufactory, which provided not only the Galician and Transcarpathia regions but also the Volhynia, Kholm, and Kyiv regions with salt. In 1339 Drohobych was occupied by Polish seigniors and the Drohobych salt manufactory became the part of the royal property. At that time salt was the most famous good produced in Drohobych. Chumaks from the entire Ukraine area came to Drohobych to purchase salt.</p>

                        <p>The church was restored in 1970-1971 and turned into a museum object of the Drohobych Museum of Local Lore. It has unique preserved paintings in the altar part. The interior of this church is also striking in its austere simplicity and grandeur. Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in Drohobych on Google Maps. Photos by: Maxim Ritus.”</p>
                        <p>Today, the church needs a new renovation. Therefore, it is almost impossible for tourists to get into it. But the firefighters, on whose territory the church is located, never refuse those wishing to inspect its facade up close.</p>

                        <p>It was built between 1844 and 1863. Up to 1918 it served as the Main Synagogue of Galicia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After World War II Drohobych belonged to the Soviet Union. The authorities converted the building to a warehouse and altered it accordingly. In later years it deteriorated. After Ukraine gained its independence it was returned to the Jewish community. Renovation started in 2014. It was completed in 2018.</p>
